        THE BMW M STORY.

        1972
is both the birth year of BMW Motorsport GmbH, as well as the Hollywood actor Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. And since then, both have pushed life to its utmost limits, always giving 110 percent. It fits nicely with the inaugural words of the former board member, Robert A. Lutz, when BMW M GmbH was founded: “A company is like a person. If he does sports, then he is well-trained, enthusiastic, and highly-capable.” The name may have changed, but what’s inside is just as “highly-capable” as forty years ago.Join us as Domagoj Dukec takes us for an exclusive first look, revealing how circular design and the principles of RE:THINK, RE:DUCE, RE:USE and RE:CYCLE informed the look and feel of the BMW i Vision Circular. Learn first-hand how clever use of secondary materials, energy-efficient production processes, smart tech and an overall entirely new circular approach to car production came together to create a vision for the future of mobility.
And make sure to swing by the RE:BMW Circular Lab, too, for a further deep dive into the BMW Group’s vision of a circular and sustainable model for the future of mobility.

        at the European Championship: the BMW 3.0 CSL was one of the most successful touring cars between 1973 and 1979. At that time, it was the first car to proudly wear the typical BMW M racing design and was also called the “batmobile” due to is massive tail wing. Three stripes of blue, violet and red on a snow-white background made up the design language for an entire racing team for the first time – from the car transporter to the key ring. And to this day, they still characterise the look of BMW Motorsport.</big>

It has been through dedication, a commitment to quality and a desire to deliver what has come to be known as THE premium automobile brand in the world, that BMW has not only earned the title of legend and icon, but retained that title through the decades, becoming each and every day a vehicle motorists aspire to own and to covet.</big><br>
